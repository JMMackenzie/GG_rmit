Box & Whisker Plots
===================

The box & whisker plot can be used to plot things such as timings or
other similar continuous data. It's a good way to show medians as well
as variance in the reported numbers. Furthermore, these plots can be
modified to also report the mean (and other such statistics).


Data
----
I have provided a file `boxplot.csv` which contains some continuous
data I generated.
