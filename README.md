GGPlot2 Tutorial
================
*Joel Mackenzie, RMIT University*

This tutorial describes some of the approaches I take in drawing what are
hopefully seen as pretty graphs. For each example, I will provide the dataset
used as well as the final script to generate the plot. For each plot, some
preliminary versions may be shown to describe potential issues and to show
how these are overcome.
